This repo analyzes the economic feasibility of shipping carbon dioxide from Europe to US ports. It uses Monte Carlo simulations to model costs and logistics, offering insights on terminal locations and shipping infrastructure.

## Key Highlights

- Simulates dynamic shipping variables: distance, capacity, trip duration.
- Analyzes CO2 transport costs across the Atlantic.
- Produces visualizations and markdown reports within Jupyter notebooks.

## Tech Stack

- Jupyter Notebook (Python)
- Required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/carbon-storage-projections.git
    cd carbon-storage-projections
    ```

2. (Optionally) Set up a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
    ```

4. Start Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

Now, dive into the various notebooks to explore the analyses.
